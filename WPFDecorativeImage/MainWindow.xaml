                AutomationProperties.HelpText="A portrait orientation picture, framed with a thick black border, with the image slightly skewed. The aspect ratio of the image is around 1.4:1. The image background is white, with a solid gray bar down the left side, with the bar being around 20% the width of the full background. Two thick sides of an equilateral triangle appear in black in the middle of the image, with the vertical left side of the triangle rising from the bottom of the image, around 30% from the left edge, to around 20% from the top of the image. The hypotenuse then falls downwards towards the right from the top of the vertical bar, to reach the bottom of the image about 15% from the right side of the image. Prominent in the space at the right side of the image is a thick black dot with a thick white circle around it, followed by a thinner dark gray circle. Most parts of the image so far described appear slight fuzzy in a style of computer screen visuals being magnified significantly. Surrounding the tip of the triangle is a wavy gray circle, with some apparent translucency where it overlaps the darker gray bar at the left side of the image. Part of a larger concentric wavy circle is also shown over the gray bar."
